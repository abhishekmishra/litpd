# Hello World

This literate program contains the "hello world" program in a few
programming languages.

This file serves as a test program to check the sanity of your **litpd** installation.

Once you run this file through your **litpd** installation, you should
have the `helloworld.html` file which is the readable version of this
program, and the various "hello world" programs in the listings below, such as `helloworld.py`, `helloworld.lua`, etc.

If you see any error messages or one of the files is missing, then there might be issues with your **litpd** installation.

# Python

```python  {code_file="helloworld.py"}
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("Hello World!")
```

# Lua
```lua  {code_file="helloworld.lua"}
print("Hello World!")
